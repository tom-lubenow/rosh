# Rosh - A Modern Mobile Shell

Rosh is a Rust implementation of a mobile shell, inspired by Mosh but built from the ground up with modern technologies and security practices.
It provides robust remote terminal access over unstable networks with automatic reconnection, predictive echo, and efficient state synchronization.

It is not intended to be compatible with Mosh, as it uses an entirely different protocol.

It should be considered extremely experimental at this time and probably not yet working at all.
